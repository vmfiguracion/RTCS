SYSC 3303 - Assignment 3

Client.java - Invokes one of the main methods of the project. Will send requests to the Intermediate class
			  and receives acknowledgement packets from the Intermediate class. A reply from the Intermediate
			  class is required before sending another packet. Acknowledgement packets will be requested by the
			  Client class rather than waiting for them to arrive. 

Intermediate.java - 	Invokes one of the main methods of the project. Will receive packets from both Client.java
						and Server.java. Will forward the data from one of the java classes to the other. ie If the
						packet came from the Client.java class then it will forward that packet to the Server.java
						class and vice versa.

Server.java - Invokes one of the main methods of the project. Requests packets from the Intermediate class and form
			  an acknowledgement packet to be sent to the Client.java class. Acknowledgements are different depending on
			  the request (ie read request or write request). The server will stop if an invalid request has been sent.

Packet.java - Helper class for packaging and sending packets.  

Setup: Make sure that there are three different consoles. Run each class separately with the Intermediate.java class first, 
	   then the Client.java, and then lastly the Server.java.
