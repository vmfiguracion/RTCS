SYSC 3303 - Assignment 2

Client.java - Invokes one of the main methods of the project. Will send requests to the IntermediateHost class
			  and receives acknowledgement packets from the IntermediateHost class. 

IntermediateHost.java - Invokes one of the main methods of the project. Will receive packets from both Client.java
						and Server.java. Will forward the data from one of the java classes to the other. ie If the
						packet came from the Client.java class then it will forward that packet to the Server.java
						class and vice versa.

Server.java - Invokes one of the main methods of the project. Receives packets from the IntermediateHost class and form
			  an acknowledgement packet to be sent to the Client.java class. Acknowledgements are different depending on
			  the request (ie read request or write request). The server will stop if an invalid request has been sent.

Setup: Make sure that there are three different consoles. Run each class separately with the Server.java class first, 
	   then the IntermediateHost.java, and then lastly the Client.java.
